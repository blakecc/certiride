            <p>Buying a car from Certiride is a good idea for many reasons – two of them are price, and quality:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>We will give you a <b>better price than a dealer, or "cash for your car" service.</b> For example, a 2010 Hyundai i20 1.6 would sell for about R115 000 – R120 000 (including compulsory dealer fees) whereas you could get the same car on Certiride for about R 95 000.</li>
                <li>All our <b>cars must pass our rigorous 200-point Certiride Inspection and Test Drive done by an experienced mechanic.</b> Other requirements include having a full service history available, and ensuring the vehicle hasn’t previously been in a serious accident. This means that there are only high quality cars at Certiride. No lemons.</li>

          <p>Certiride is able to offer a better price than a dealership because we have lower costs, and better data:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Typically, dealers over-price cars (even more-so once all the extra fees are considered). At Certiride, all our cars are priced correctly using a sophisticated algorithm that takes into account market data, and the condition of the car.</li>
            <li>We have much fewer costs than a dealership since we don’t own the cars or have an expensive dealership showroom floor (or espresso lounge!).</li>
            <li>What you see here is what you will pay. We don't add on a whole bunch of extra fees which you would pay at a dealership.</li>

          <p>You can, of course, but before doing that be aware of a few things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>They will not do vehicle inspections as comprehensive as ours, or be as transparent about all the vehicle imperfections</li>
            <li>You will have to negotiate as dealers try to get the maximum possible for each vehicle (whereas Certiride uses an algorithm to price vehicles correctly and fairly to begin with)</li>
            <li>You will be forced to pay hefty “on the road” fees and purchase add-on products which can easily total over R15 000 (in addition to their already larger mark-ups).</li>

            <p>Historically, when selling a car, you were faced with two options:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Sell your car to a dealership (i.e. trade it in).</b> With this option you have the convenience of time, but you’re typically offered far less than what you could get selling privately (e.g. for a 2010 Hyundai i20 1.6 you’d be offered ~R 70 000 but you could get far more privately if you knew what to do).</li>
                <li><b>Sell your car privately.</b> With this option you can get the price you deserve, but it comes with some hard work. You need to do all of your advertising, figure out your selling price and take your car to potential buyers for test drives. Once you have a Buyer, you’ll have to start negotiations and work out how to do the financial transaction which poses a financial risk, and security threats. Also, don’t forget the paperwork and queues at the Licencing Department.</li>

For that same Hyundai we’d aim to get you R90 000 into your bank account without you having to lift a finger. We find your buyer for you, and arrange the test drives on your behalf. To do this, we keep your car safely in consignment and reimburse you for using Uber while we have your car.</li>

          <p>No, we only take a small commission once we’ve actually sold your car. For our commission, we use a profit-share model: We guarantee you a minimum amount for your car, but anything above that we split 50/50. So, if for example we guaranteed you R80 000 for your Hyundai, but actually sold it for R95 000, you’d get R86 500 into your bank account.</p>
          <p>So, in other words, there are no upfront fees or admin fees. We only get paid if we do our job, which is to sell your car!</p>
