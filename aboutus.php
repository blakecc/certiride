                    <p>Certiride started because of our experience of how difficult and frustrating it can be to find and buy a good used car in South Africa, without being ripped off. Not only were we frustrated with buying a car, we were annoyed with the unfairly low amounts we were offered for a trade-in by dealerships. Selling or buying a car privately seemed like it may be a better deal, but it's typically unsafe, time consuming, and risky. Certiride is improving on the old ways of buying and selling cars.</p>
